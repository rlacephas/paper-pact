This paper introduces {\em combined profiling} (CP): a new practical
methodology to produce statistically sound combined profiles from
multiple runs of a program.  Combining profiles is often necessary to
properly characterize the behavior of a program to support
Feedback-Directed Optimization (FDO).  \CP\ models program behaviors
over multiple runs by estimating their empirical distributions,
providing the inferential power of probability distributions to code
transformations.  These distributions are build from traditional
single-run point profiles; no new profiling infrastructure is
required.  The small fixed size of this data representation keeps
profile sizes, and the computational costs of profile queries,
independent of the number of profiles combined.  However, when using
even a single program run, a \CP\ maintains the information available
in the point profile, allowing \CP\ to be used as a drop-in
replacement for existing techniques. The quality of the information
generated by the \CP\ methodology is evaluated in \llvm\ using SPEC
CPU 2006 benchmarks.
