}

The first experiment was to tune in the value of the compiler parameters.
 A machine learning algorithm was used to find the sweetspot for a set of
 inlining parameters. As described in Section~\ref{sec:ml}, we used
 SPSA - Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation because we have no
 supposition on the function and on the search space.

The second experiment was performed to evaluate and compare two different cases,
 the case of single-runs, and the case of \CP\-runs. Both cases are analyzed and
 compared.

The third experiment was conducted to verify and 
  analyze behavior variability for random choice, simple sort and
  a version of the knapsack problem. Particularly the latter version presented better results.
