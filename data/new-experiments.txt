Two goals:
		1.  Characterize the variability in the workload
		2.  Quantify how well CP captures (1)


New Research:
1.  CP for the CG
2.  HN with paths
3.  CP and definite flow?
4.  CFG vs IR: maintaining profile information through transformations

2.  Overlap over the range of possilbe training workload sizes
		- leave-one-out
		- leave-two-out
		- leave 3, ..., 997 out: 200 random samples
		- leave 998 out (ie, vs two)
		- leave 999 out (ie, vs single)
		- or k-fold xval?

3.  Overlap histograms

4.  Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test (Predicability)
		- k-fold cross-validation (k=5,10,20,25)
		- histogram the alpha values? (1 alpha per edge per fold)
		- vertical scatter/violin plots of D vals with alpha isolines?


Requirements:
  - Split workload into k randomly selected parts
	- Run a k-fold xval with a pluggable metric
	- Repeatedly partition workload randomly, without repetition, into 
    size m and n-m sub-workloads
